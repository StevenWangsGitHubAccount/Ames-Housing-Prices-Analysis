# Ames-Housing-Prices-Analysis

This is a data science project that predicts the sale prices of homes, based upon their features (e.g., lot size, total living area, year of construction, etc.). The training set contains 79 features.

The dataset is the Ames Housing dataset, available on Kaggle, which includes information on 2920 home sales in Ames, Iowa, from 2006 through 2010. Kaggle splits the dataset in half, creating training and test sets of equal size (1460). The data can be found at Kaggle's House Prices competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). I've included copies of the data in this repository (housingpricestrain.csv and housingpricestest.csv, respectively).

The analysis, data visualization, and Python code can be viewed in the iPython notebook, "Ames House Prices Final". Because running the code can be time-consuming, I've also included a html file (AmesHousePricesFinalhtml) that shows the code and data visualization.

Finally, I've included a slide deck that summarizes the results (Final Project slides).
